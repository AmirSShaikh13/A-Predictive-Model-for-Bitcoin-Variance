# A-Predictive-Model-for-Bitcoin-Variance
The project analyzes data from Marathon Digital Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining company, to examine variances in Bitcoin mining efficiency and profitability. We conduct variance analysis and develop predictive models focused on hash rate. Key parameters are analyzed to maximize daily mined blocks, enhancing overall mining efficiency.
