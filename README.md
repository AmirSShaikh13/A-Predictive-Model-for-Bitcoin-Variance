# A-Predictive-Model-for-Bitcoin-Variance
The project analyzes data from Marathon Digital Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining company, to examine variances in Bitcoin mining efficiency and profitability. We conduct variance analysis and develop predictive models focused on hash rate. Key parameters are analyzed to maximize daily mined blocks, enhancing overall mining efficiency.

# Marathon Digital Holdings - Cryptocurrency Mining Analytics Project

## Overview

This project analyzes historical data from Marathon Digital Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining company, to uncover insights into variances in Bitcoin mining efficiency and profitability. The aim is to conduct variance analysis and develop predictive models focused on hash rate to enhance mining operations.

## About the Sponsor

Marathon Digital Holdings, formerly known as Marathon Patent Group, is a publicly traded company on NASDAQ under the symbol "MARA." The companyâ€™s mission is to create the world's most decentralized and secure monetary network by sustainably increasing its computational power (hash rate). Marathon primarily mines Bitcoin by validating transactions and securing the Bitcoin network, and has also made strategic investments in cryptocurrency-related businesses.

## Objectives

This project involves two main objectives:

1. **Variance Analysis**: Analyze historical mining data to determine variances and identify underlying factors affecting mining performance.
  
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a model to predict variances beyond normal distribution, focusing on hash rate dynamics. This includes assigning a variance score to compare observed values against predicted values.

## Data Analytics Solution

The proposed analytics solution aims to maximize daily mined blocks from the pool with the highest hash rate. Key parameters for analysis include:

- **Timestamp**: Time of mining activity.
- **Height**: Block height in the blockchain.
- **Version**: Version of the mining software used.
- **Bitcoins**: Amount of Bitcoin mined.
- **Transaction Count**: Number of transactions in a block.
- **Reward Fees**: Fees earned from mining.
- **Confirmations**: Number of confirmations a block has received.
- **Pool Name**: The mining pool associated with rewards.

By analyzing these data points, we aim to gain insights into mining efficiency and profitability across different pools, overall network activity, and factors influencing mining rewards.
